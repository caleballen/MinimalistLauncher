# MinimalistLauncher
A launcher for Android built to help with screen addiction and bad habits. Currently works as a functional launcher - I've used it for the past couple of weeks! The next stage will be adding app time monitoring, lockout functions and some form of "desert island" app selection to restrict usage to just the necessary apps.
